## The Program

The MFA in Vocal Pedagogy prepares singer-teachers to integrate voice science, pedagogical history, and reflective teaching practice. Students complete original thesis research as the capstone of their degree — designing studies, collecting data, and producing work that contributes to the field.

## Research Supervision

MFA thesis students are supervised through a three-semester sequence (MFA Thesis I, II, III) that moves from question formation and literature review through methodology, data collection, analysis, and defense.

Research in this program spans a wide range of methodologies:

- **Acoustic analysis** — spectral measures, voice quality indices, pre/post comparisons
- **Physiological monitoring** — heart rate, respiratory measures, real-time biofeedback
- **Perceptual evaluation** — expert listener ratings, standardized scales
- **Survey and interview** — validated instruments, qualitative coding
- **Mixed methods** — combining physiological, acoustic, and self-report data

## This Archive

The research archive is built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org) and uses [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) for interactive figures. All analysis notebooks are rendered with code hidden — the focus is on the data, the figures, and the interpretation.

Analysis pipelines are written in Python. Source code and raw data are maintained separately in the program's working repository.
