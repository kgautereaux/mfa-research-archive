    "text": "This analysis presents acoustic and perceptual data from a study comparing vocal exercises derived from animal imitations (owl, cat, cow) with exercises derived from the corresponding vowel imitations (/u/, /æ/, /ɑ/). Five participants each completed two sessions — one animal-based, one vowel-based — with acoustic measures extracted from mimics, exercises, and a target song (“Somewhere Over the Rainbow”) recorded at baseline and after each exercise block.\nAcoustic measures: f0, jitter, shimmer, HNR, intensity (calibrated), spectral moments (CoG, spectral SD, skewness, kurtosis), CPPS, H1-H2, F1, F2, alpha ratio, L/H ratio, LTAS slope/tilt, AVQI.\nPerceptual measure: Omni-VES (Vocal Effort Scale), rated by researcher and participant self-assessment.\nStatistical approach: Cohen’s d with bootstrapped 95% CIs, Spearman rank correlations. Emphasis on effect sizes and patterns over p-values given n = 5.\nFormant caveat: Formant estimation is unreliable when f0 exceeds ~350 Hz. Owl mimics (~570 Hz) and “where” targets (~520 Hz) are flagged; cat mimics (~430 Hz) are borderline; cow mimics (~320 Hz) and “some” targets (~260 Hz) are reliable."

The cow sound invites a fundamentally different way of using the voice compared to singing /ɑ/ — more modal, more stable, lower pitch.\nCat changes resonance and spectrum: spectral SD d = +3.21, F2 d = +2.78, CoG d = +1.93. The meow concentrates energy in the upper spectrum in a way that singing /æ/ does not.\nOwl changes intensity and stability: intensity d = +2.57, shimmer dB d = −2.13. The owl hoo is essentially a more projected, more stable version of the vowel.\n\nThis is the most robust finding in the study. The effect sizes are very large (d &gt; 2 for multiple measures across all three pairs) and consistent within pairs."

The actual sequence of exercises was randomized per participant and session. This means we can ask: does the preceding exercise type predict the direction and magnitude of change in the subsequent Somewhere probe?\nThe figures below show mean change from baseline for each acoustic measure, grouped by which exercise was performed immediately before the Somewhere probe. Because the order was randomized, exercise-type effects can be partially separated from cumulative warm-up (dosage) effects.\n\n\n                            \n                                            \n\n\n                            \n                                            \n\n\n\nAnimal Condition\nIn the animal condition, the cow/a exercises produce the most distinctive carry-over pattern on Tier 1 measures (those that survived every robustness test in the audit):\n\nJitter: Cow produces a tight cluster of near-zero changes (mean change +0.0002), while owl and cat produce wider spread. The variability across exercise types (spread d = 0.89) is larger than typical within-group variability.\nf0 SD: Cow is associated with reduced pitch instability (mean change -2.35 Hz), while cat and owl show less consistent patterns (spread d = 1.26).\nHNR: Cow-preceded probes show the largest HNR increase (+1.45 dB on “some”), consistent with cow’s phonation-domain acoustic signature.\n\n\n\nVowel Condition\nThe vowel condition (Session B) shows smaller and less consistent differences across exercise types. No single exercise type dominates, and the error bars overlap substantially. This is consistent with the overall finding that the animal mimics produce more acoustically distinct effects than their vowel counterparts.\n\n\nTemporal Position vs. Exercise Type\nBecause the exercise order was randomized, we can test whether changes correlate with temporal position (1st, 2nd, or 3rd exercise block) rather than exercise type. No Spearman correlation between temporal position and acoustic change reaches statistical significance in any condition-target-measure combination. This means the patterns above reflect what the singer just did (motor priming from the specific exercise), not how long they have been exercising (cumulative warm-up).\nThis is a meaningful distinction for pedagogy: it suggests that each exercise primes specific articulatory and phonatory patterns, and the most recent priming is what gets captured in the subsequent singing. The carry-over is exercise-specific, not dose-dependent."

But this is a between-vowel confound — the cow pair, which produces higher perturbation and lower HNR, also requires the most vocal effort.\nWithin vowels, the story changes:\n\nFor /ɑ/: Shimmer (ρ = +0.50) and HNR (ρ = −0.50) still correlate with VES, but CPPS and H1-H2 also appear. Breathier phonation and lower cepstral prominence associate with higher perceived effort.\nFor /æ/: Skewness, kurtosis, and intensity are the strongest predictors. Less spectral complexity associates with higher perceived effort.\nFor /u/: The pattern partially reverses. HNR is positively correlated with VES, opposite to the pooled direction. LTAS tilt is the strongest predictor.\n\nThe key finding is not that VES tracks effort — it’s designed to — but that the acoustic correlates of perceived effort are vowel-dependent. What constitutes “effortful” singing differs by vowel context. There is no single acoustic profile that predicts perceived effort across all conditions. This has implications for how we evaluate vocal exercises — effort criteria should be vowel-appropriate, not one-size-fits-all.\nThe qualitative notes reinforce this: owl mimics receive consistently positive quality descriptions (“ease,” “lofted space,” “relaxed”) and correspondingly low effort ratings (researcher VES = 2 for 4 of 5 participants). Cow mimics receive notes about strain and effortful production and correspondingly high effort ratings.

    "text": "Qualitative Observations\nThe researcher (Morgan) recorded observations on strain/tension, breath support, resonance/placement, and general impressions for every segment across all 10 sessions. These observations ground the acoustic findings in the language voice teachers actually use.\n\nThemes by Animal-Vowel Pair\nOwl / /u/ — “Ease,” “lofted space,” “relaxed”\nThe owl mimic consistently elicited the most positive quality language. Descriptions include: “none to be heard” (re: strain), “a good amount of release and ease,” “good lofted, back mouth space,” and “all four reps are very similar in timbre, pitch, breath control.” The owl exercises continued this pattern: “still sounded easeful,” “relatively free, easy, relaxed vibrato and breath.” Acoustically, this maps to low perturbation, high intensity, and spectrally narrow output.\nCat / /æ/ — “Twang/ping,” “pressing,” “constriction”\nThe cat mimic produced mixed observations — positive resonance features alongside effortful production: “some good ping starting to develop” but also “some tightness potentially around the larynx/pharynx” and “some pharyngeal constriction.” Multiple participants naturally produced an /m/ onset, reflecting the natural onset of “meow.” Acoustically, this maps to high spectral SD, high CoG, and high F2 — the meow engages M2 resonance but sometimes through effort rather than ease.\nCow / /ɑ/ — “Vocal fry,” “pressing in fry,” “registration breaks”\nThe cow mimic is defined by registration traversal — chest voice through fry into head voice. Notes consistently flag: “some strain in the fry/chest,” “brightness in the chest/warmth in the head — not much connection throughout,” and “fry to M2 to fry.” The exercises show the pattern continuing: “seems to be some pressing at the vocal fold level here.” This maps to the HNR/f0 SD/perturbation pattern, and the H1-H2 divergence across reps.\n\n\n“Somewhere” Trajectory — What the Listener Heard\nDespite noisy group-level acoustic data, the researcher consistently perceived progressive improvement:\n\nP1: Baseline “some adduction issues” → Post-Cow “less overall tension, better phrasing, more focus and ping, seems to be an improvement in overall function”\nP2: Baseline “some slight strain on ascending leaps” → Post-Cow “much more ease in transition areas, the connection between the larger leaps were very successful”\nP4: Baseline “slight strain on ascending leaps” → Post-Cow “the least amount of strain yet! Registration is connected, best take yet!”\nP5: Baseline “excessive airy quality due to hypofunction” → Post-Cat “we can hear the mechanism making adjustments here in real time”\n\nBoth protocols appear to warm up the voice and build coordination. The kind of improvement may differ — the animal session developing more M2 access and registration connection, the vowel session developing more breath flow and release — but both trajectories point toward improved function."

No standing, walking, or postural changes occurred. All panelist HR variations reflect genuine autonomic responses, not movement artifacts. - Panelist 1 wore a facial mask for the duration of the experiment to avoid sharing or receiving illness. This may have contributed slightly to Panelist 1’s elevated baseline HR (~100 bpm), though the consistency across all five sessions suggests a stable individual difference rather than a masking artifact."

    "text": "Part 1: Individual Session Time Series\nEach figure shows one audition session with the singer’s HR (red) overlaid with Panelist 1 (purple), Panelist 2 (green), and Panelist 3 (blue). Shaded bands indicate audition phases.\nPanelist baseline context: The three panelists – all seated throughout – show a stable hierarchy across all sessions: Panelist 1 runs highest (~98-108 bpm), Panelist 3 is moderate (~75-95 bpm), and Panelist 2 is lowest (~55-65 bpm). Panelist 2’s HR is essentially resting heart rate for a seated adult. These individual differences in resting autonomic tone are consistent across all five sessions, suggesting stable trait-level variation rather than differential responses to specific singers.\n\nSession 1 – Singer 1 (M)\nSinger 1 begins around 127 bpm and ramps steadily upward through song 1 (prepared piece), reaching peaks near 160 bpm. There is a brief dip during the inter-song gap, followed by a sharp rise into song 2 (assigned piece), where HR reaches its highest sustained values (~155-158 bpm). The three panelists hold flat: Panelist 1 around 100-108 bpm, Panelist 3 at 85-95 bpm, and Panelist 2 near 58 bpm. The singer’s activation gap above the panelist mean is ~60-70 bpm during performance.\n\n\n        \n        \n        \n\n\n                                                    \n\n\n\n\nSession 2 – Singer 2 (F)\nSinger 2 shows the steepest ramp-up of any singer – HR climbs from ~120 bpm at the start to peak near 169 bpm during song 1 (prepared). HR drops modestly during the inter-song gap (~145 bpm) but rebounds during song 2 (assigned), reaching ~155 bpm. Panelist 1 drifts from 108 down to ~100 bpm; Panelist 3 hovers in the 75-90 bpm range; Panelist 2 holds steady near 57 bpm. The activation gap widens as the session progresses.\n\n\n                                                    \n\n\n\n\nSession 3 – Singer 3 (F)\nSinger 3 follows a similar arc to Singer 2 – gradual climb through the pre-singing phase, sustained elevation during song 1 (135-165 bpm), partial recovery in the gap, and a plateau during song 2 (~150-158 bpm). Panelist 1 is steady around 101-107 bpm; Panelist 3 is at 80-95 bpm; Panelist 2 stays near 58-60 bpm. The inter-song gap shows a brief but noticeable HR spike in Panelist 3’s trace – likely anticipatory activation as the panelist prepares for the next performance (see Panelist Anticipatory Activation below).\n\n\n                                                    \n\n\n\n\nSession 4 – Singer 4 (F)\nSinger 4 is a clear outlier. HR starts around 80-90 bpm in the pre-singing phase – within the range typically seen in a panelist, not a singer. During song 1, HR rises modestly to ~105-120 bpm, well below the 140-170 bpm range seen in other singers. During song 2, HR actually drops below baseline, reaching the mid-70s. This is the most visually striking session in the dataset: the singer’s trace overlaps with Panelist 1 and Panelist 3, while Panelist 2 runs below all of them. Panelist 1 spikes to ~113 bpm during the inter-song gap – the highest F1 variability in any session (sd=5.8). Panelist 3 is similarly variable (sd=8.1 during the gap).\nImportant context: Panelist 3 had a pre-existing private studio teaching relationship with Singer 4. Panelist 1 had previously taught all five participants in a classroom setting. Singer 4’s reduced HR may reflect the familiarity of the studio teacher-student relationship, individual differences in autonomic reactivity, anxiolytic medication use (not screened for), or some combination.\n\n\n                                                    \n\n\n\n\nSession 5 – Singer 5 (M)\nSinger 5 shows the highest sustained HR of any participant. Starting from a pre-singing baseline of ~135-140 bpm (already elevated), HR climbs rapidly through song 1 to peaks near 184 bpm. The inter-song gap provides minimal recovery (~165 bpm), and song 2 drives HR to its highest sustained values (~170-180 bpm). The three panelists form a clear floor: Panelist 1 at 96-106 bpm, Panelist 3 at 73-85 bpm, Panelist 2 at 54-59 bpm. The widest activation gap in the study occurs here – ~91 bpm between singer and the 3-panelist mean during song 2."

    "text": "Part 2: Cross-Session Comparisons\n\nSinger HR by Audition Phase\nThe grouped bar chart below shows each singer’s mean HR (with standard deviation bars) during the four performance phases. The pattern is consistent across four of five singers: HR is lowest during pre-singing, rises sharply for song 1, dips slightly during the inter-song gap, and remains elevated or continues rising into song 2. Singer 4 is the exception – her HR stays in the 88-106 bpm range across all phases, never approaching the 140+ bpm levels seen in the others.\nKey observation: Pre-singing baseline HR is remarkably similar across Singers 1, 2, 3, and 5 (~126-143 bpm), suggesting comparable levels of anticipatory anxiety before singing begins. Singer 4’s pre-singing HR (~91 bpm) is 35-50 bpm lower than the group.\n\n\n                                                    \n\n\n\n\nSinger-Panelist Activation Gap\nThe chart below quantifies the HR difference between each singer and the mean of all three panelists for each phase. The gap reflects how far the singer’s autonomic activation exceeds the panelists’ – a rough index of the anxiety asymmetry in the audition relationship. With Panelist 2 included (mean HR ~58 bpm, seated), the 3-panelist average is lower than the earlier 2-panelist estimate, so activation gaps are wider.\nSingers 1, 2, 3, and 5 show gaps of 38-91 bpm, widening as the session progresses. The gap is largest during the inter-song gap and song 2 for most singers – suggesting that the stress of performing the assigned piece (less familiar, less rehearsed) compounds the already elevated state from song 1.\nSinger 4’s gap is small but positive (+8 bpm during song 2) – her HR stays close to the panelist range. This is the only singer whose physiological state approximates the panelists’.\n\n\n                                                    \n\n\n\n\nHR Reactivity Profiles\nThe dot-and-line plot below connects each singer’s mean HR across the four phases, making the shape of each stress response visible.\nFour distinct profiles emerge:\n\nSinger 5 – highest absolute HR, steep climb, no recovery between songs. The most pronounced stress response in the study.\nSinger 2 – steep initial climb during song 1, partial recovery in the gap, rebound for song 2. Classic performance anxiety arc.\nSingers 1 and 3 – moderate, steady climb. Singer 1 shows the most gradual escalation; Singer 3 plateaus earlier.\nSinger 4 – flat trajectory near 90 bpm. Modest rise during song 1, return to baseline for song 2. This profile resembles a panelist more than a performer.\n\n\n\n                                                    \n\n\n\n\nNormalized HR Trajectories\nAll five singers’ HR traces plotted on a common timeline, each zeroed to their own pre-singing baseline mean. This removes differences in resting HR and shows the magnitude of change from baseline.\nWith a 10-second rolling average for readability:\n\nSingers 2 and 5 show the largest sustained elevations (~25-40 bpm above baseline).\nSinger 1 shows a moderate, steady rise (~15-30 bpm above baseline).\nSinger 3 shows a moderate rise with more variability.\nSinger 4 shows the smallest reactivity – peaking around +15 bpm during song 1, then dropping below baseline during song 2."

The rank ordering is notable: Singer 5 (highest K-MPAI, 174) also shows the highest sustained HR in the study, while Singer 2 (lowest K-MPAI, 111) shows the steepest HR ramp-up but also the most recovery between songs. Singer 4 (K-MPAI 159 – second highest) is the most interesting case: high self-reported anxiety with the lowest physiological response. Several factors may contribute, including the studio relationship with Panelist 3, individual autonomic differences, or anxiolytic medication (not screened for in this study).\nFaculty panelists:\n\n\n\nPanelist\nK-MPAI\nClinical?\nMAAQ Flexibility\nMean HR (seated)\n\n\n\n\nPanelist 1\n109 (2 items missing)\nYes\n24\n~101 bpm\n\n\nPanelist 2\n102\nNo\n33\n~58 bpm\n\n\nPanelist 3\n169\nYes\n32\n~85 bpm\n\n\n\nPanelist 3’s K-MPAI (169) is notably high – higher than any study participant except Singer 5. For a panelist whose own performance anxiety is elevated, evaluating singers (especially her own student, Singer 4) may carry additional physiological weight. Panelist 2 falls just below the clinical threshold at 102 and shows the lowest HR of anyone in the study – essentially resting heart rate while seated. The K-MPAI ranking on the faculty side (F3 &gt; F1 &gt; F2) does not map directly to their HR ranking (F1 &gt; F3 &gt; F2), but Panelist 2 being the calmest on both measures is consistent.\nLimitation: The study did not screen for anxiolytic medication use (beta blockers, SSRIs, benzodiazepines) in singers or faculty panelists. Any participant using such medication could show attenuated HR responses that do not reflect their underlying anxiety level.\n\nK-MPAI Scoring Note\nThe Qualtrics-generated SC0 score differs from our computed score by a constant of +40 across all 26 respondents (verified: identical SDs, perfect rank correlation). Qualtrics scores the K-MPAI on a 1-7 internal scale, while Kenny (2009) specifies 0-6. Both apply the same reverse coding on the same 8 items – the only difference is a +1 shift per item across all 40 items (40 x 1 = 40). We use the published 0-6 convention. The Qualtrics threshold equivalent of &gt;=105 is &gt;=145."

    "text": "Part 4: Anxiety Measures and Heart Rate\nThis section connects the self-report data from Part 3 to the physiological record.\n\nK-MPAI x Heart Rate (RQ2)\nDoes higher trait performance anxiety predict higher physiological arousal during the audition? With n = 5 singers, Spearman rank correlations are used. The critical value for significance at p &lt; 0.05 (two-tailed) with n = 5 is |r_s| = 1.000, so no correlation can reach conventional significance.

Singer 4’s position breaks any monotonic pattern: she has the second-highest K-MPAI (159) but the lowest HR across every measure. If Singer 4 were removed, the remaining four singers show a near-monotonic positive relationship between K-MPAI and Mean Song HR. Several factors may contribute to Singer 4’s low HR: the pre-existing studio teaching relationship with Panelist 3, individual differences in autonomic reactivity, or anxiolytic medication use (not screened for in this study). With n = 5, a single case can shift the entire correlation.\n\n\n                                                    \n\n\n\n\nPost-Survey x Heart Rate Correlations\n\nSinger Self-Report\nSingers completed an 8-item post-performance survey (1-5 Likert) immediately after their audition. Each item is correlated with their mean song HR.\nCritical finding: “Felt anxious” has zero variance. All five singers rated their anxiety at 4 out of 5. With no rank-order variance, the correlation is undefined. This is itself a substantive result: every singer, including Singer 4 (whose HR was near panelist levels), self-reported high anxiety. The audition context produced a universal subjective experience of anxiety regardless of the physiological response, consistent with research showing that cognitive and somatic anxiety components can dissociate.\n\n\n\nSurvey Item\nDirection\nvs Mean Song HR (r_s)\n\n\n\n\nFelt confident\npositive\n+0.35\n\n\nFelt anxious\nnegative\nNaN (no variance)\n\n\nFelt authentic\npositive\n0.00\n\n\nFelt safe to express\npositive\n0.00\n\n\nEmotionally connected\npositive\n+0.78\n\n\nEmotionally disconnected\nnegative\n-0.05\n\n\nEnjoyed performing\npositive\n+0.37\n\n\nDid not feel satisfaction\nnegative\n+0.63\n\n\n\n“Emotionally connected” shows the strongest positive correlation with HR (r_s = +0.78, p = 0.118). Singers with higher HR reported feeling more emotionally connected to their performance, not less. This is consistent with the idea that physiological activation during performance is not purely aversive: it can coexist with engagement and emotional presence.\n\n\nFaculty Perception x Singer HR\nFaculty panelists rated each singer on 6 items after each audition. All three panelists watched each performance simultaneously, so ratings of a single singer’s performance are correlated.\nPrimary Analysis: Singer-Averaged Ratings (n = 5)\nThe 3 panelists’ ratings are averaged per singer, then correlated with singer HR.

Panelists rated higher-HR singers as appearing more confident, not less. The n=15 pooled analysis (below) showed p = 0.057, but that p-value is anti-conservative due to non-independence.\n“Showed signs of anxiety” x Singer HR is the strongest faculty-perception correlation (r_s = -0.70). Higher-HR singers were rated as showing fewer signs of anxiety. Physiological stress was not visible to the panelists.\nPer-panelist breakdown reveals that Panelist 2 drives the “Appeared confident” pattern (r_s = +0.87), while Panelist 3 shows no relationship (r_s = -0.11). Panelist 3 (highest K-MPAI, Singer 4’s studio teacher) does not perceive high-HR singers as more confident. Panelist 2 (lowest anxiety, most stable HR) shows the strongest perceptual tracking.\n\nSupplementary: Pooled (n = 15, non-independent, anti-conservative p-values)\n\n\n\nFaculty Item\nvs Singer Mean HR (r_s)\nvs Panelist Own HR (r_s)\n\n\n\n\nAppeared confident\n+0.50 (p=.057)\n-0.14\n\n\nShowed signs of anxiety\n-0.40 (p=.138)\n-0.12\n\n\nFelt authentic\n-0.03\n-0.20\n\n\nEmotionally connected\n-0.07\n-0.03\n\n\nEmotionally disconnected\n-0.09\n+0.12\n\n\nAppeared to enjoy performing\n+0.34\n+0.02\n\n\n\nPanelist own HR shows no meaningful correlation with any perception item.\n\n\n                                                    \n\n\n\n\n\nTrajectory Features\nThe mean-level correlations above collapse each singer’s entire song performance into a single HR value. This section preserves temporal structure by extracting trajectory features from HR time series during each song phase and fitting individual growth curves.\n\n\nTrajectory Features\nFive features were extracted from each singer’s HR during song_1 and song_2, then averaged across both songs:\n\nSlope: linear regression slope of HR over normalized time (0 = song onset, 1 = song offset). Using normalized time avoids a confound with song duration.\nAUC above baseline: area under the HR curve above the singer’s pre-singing baseline HR, normalized by duration (bpm above resting).\nTime to Peak: seconds from phase start to maximum HR\nHR Range: max minus min HR within the phase (amplitude of fluctuation)\nRecovery: HR at phase end minus HR at phase start (positive = continued climbing, negative = recovery)\n\n\n\n\nFeature\nK-MPAI r_s\np\nMAAQ Flex. r_s\np\n\n\n\n\nSlope (bpm/norm. time)\n+0.70\n0.188\n-0.70\n0.188\n\n\nAUC above baseline (bpm)\n-0.30\n0.624\n+0.30\n0.624\n\n\nTime to Peak\n+0.30\n0.624\n-0.30\n0.624\n\n\nHR Range\n+0.90\n0.037\n-0.90\n0.037\n\n\nRecovery\n+0.70\n0.188\n-0.70\n0.188\n\n\n\nKey findings:\n\nHR Range is the strongest trajectory-anxiety association (r_s = +0.90, p = 0.037, uncorrected). Higher trait anxiety predicts wider HR fluctuation during singing. Slope and Recovery also show positive associations with K-MPAI (r_s = +0.70 each) but do not reach conventional significance. These trajectory features reveal information that mean HR obscures. Unlike the near-zero K-MPAI x Mean Song HR correlation (r_s = +0.10), the trajectory features capture the dynamic quality of the stress response.\n\nNote: All p-values are uncorrected for multiple comparisons. Across the full analysis, over 50 correlations are computed. Even the one p = 0.037 result (HR Range) would not survive Bonferroni correction. All correlations should be treated as exploratory pattern descriptions.\n\nSinger 4 no longer breaks the pattern for HR Range. In the mean HR analyses, Singer 4’s low absolute HR (despite high K-MPAI) produced flat correlations. But Singer 4’s range is actually consistent with moderate-to-high K-MPAI: she shows meaningful HR fluctuation (23-40 bpm range) even though her absolute HR stays low. The trajectory features reveal that Singer 4’s autonomic system is responding to the performance, just from a lower set point.\nRecovery is positive for all singers. No singer shows net HR recovery within either song phase. All singers’ HR is still climbing or elevated at the end of each song."

    "text": "Part 6: Same-Song Comparisons\n\nA. Same-Song Comparisons with Panelists\nBecause the assigned piece was the same within each gender group, we can compare singers’ HR during the identical musical material. Any differences in HR trajectory during the same song reflect individual anxiety responses rather than differences in musical demands.\n\n\nFemale Singers – \"If You Knew My Story\"\nDuring the assigned piece (right panel) – the same 32-bar cut – Singers 2 and 3 track closely in the 140-155 bpm range with similar contour, while Singer 4 starts at ~80 bpm and rises slowly to ~99 bpm. The separation between Singer 4 and the other two is even more striking here than during the prepared pieces, because the musical demands are identical.\n\n\n                                                    \n\n\nEach female singer during \"If You Knew My Story\" with all three panelists overlaid:\n\nSinger 2: Sustained at 140-155 bpm. All three panelists hold flat below, with Panelist 2 running lowest (~57 bpm). The singer sits 40-80+ bpm above the panelist range.\nSinger 3: Similar profile to Singer 2. Panelist traces are stable and well below.\nSinger 4: Starts at ~80 bpm – below Panelist 1 (~98 bpm) and near Panelist 3 (~92 bpm). Only Panelist 2 (~56 bpm) is consistently below her. This is the only session where the singer’s HR is intertwined with the panelists’ during active singing.\n\n\n\n                                                    \n\n\n\n\nMale Singers – \"Shiksa Goddess\"\nDuring the assigned piece (right panel), Singer 5 starts at ~166 bpm and climbs to ~180 bpm. Singer 1 starts at ~149 bpm and rises gently to ~158 bpm. The ~15-20 bpm gap between them is consistent, suggesting a stable difference in stress reactivity rather than a response to a specific musical moment.\n\n\n                                                    \n\n\nEach male singer during \"Shiksa Goddess\" with all three panelists:\n\nSinger 1: Flat trace at ~150-158 bpm.

The gap widens over the course of the song – panelists hold flat or decrease while Singer 5 continues climbing. Panelist 3 shows the clearest antiphase pattern (HR decreasing as singer’s increases).\n\n\n\n                                                    \n\n\n\n\nB. Singer-to-Singer HR During Identical Pieces\nPart 6A showed each singer alongside their panelists during the same song. This subsection removes the panelists and asks: how do singers’ HR time series compare when they perform the same song?\nThe assigned piece (song 2) provides a natural control. All three female singers (S2, S3, S4) sang “If You Knew My Story,” and both male singers (S1, S5) sang “Shiksa Goddess.” Because the song is identical within each group, the respiratory demands, musical structure, phrasing, and emotional arc are held constant. Any commonalities in HR trajectory shape reflect song-driven physiological effects. Any differences in absolute HR level reflect individual stress response.\nSong 2 durations are tightly clustered (54-58 seconds). Both absolute-time alignment (from song onset) and normalized-time alignment (0-1) are used. Pairwise Pearson correlations are computed on the raw, normalized, and 5-second smoothed time series.\n\n\nMale Singers: “Shiksa Goddess” (S1 and S5)\n\n\n\nSinger\nDuration\nHR Range\nMean HR\nK-MPAI\n\n\n\n\nS1 (M)\n58s\n149-158\n154.4\n126\n\n\nS5 (M)\n58s\n163-182\n169.9\n174\n\n\n\nPairwise correlation: r = +0.80 (normalized), r = +0.84 (smoothed).\nS1 and S5 produce nearly parallel HR trajectories: a steady upward ramp with a slight dip around the 30-40% mark, then a sustained climb to the end. S5 is offset approximately 15 bpm above S1 throughout. The shape is almost identical; the offset tracks with K-MPAI (174 vs. 126). Between-singer SD on the mean trajectory is only 7.8 bpm.\n\n\nFemale Singers: “If You Knew My Story” (S2, S3, S4)\n\n\n\nSinger\nDuration\nHR Range\nMean HR\nK-MPAI\n\n\n\n\nS2 (F)\n56s\n134-157\n147.4\n111\n\n\nS3 (F)\n55s\n141-158\n151.8\n144\n\n\nS4 (F)\n54s\n76-99\n89.5\n159\n\n\n\nPairwise correlations (normalized time):\n\n\n\nPair\nr\nr (smoothed)\n\n\n\n\nS2-S3\n+0.27\n+0.29\n\n\nS2-S4\n+0.68\n+0.71\n\n\nS3-S4\n+0.70\n+0.73\n\n\n\nS3 and S4 are strongly correlated (r = +0.70) despite being 60 bpm apart. S2-S4 similarly correlated (r = +0.68). But S2 and S3, despite similar absolute HR levels (147 vs. 152 bpm), correlate only weakly (r = +0.27), suggesting that at similar activation levels, individual-level factors (breath management, performance strategy) can override the song-driven pattern.\n\n\nWhat This Shows\nThe song imposes a shared HR contour. Singers performing the same piece correlate at r = +0.68 to +0.84 (smoothed). The musical material drives a common autonomic pattern through its respiratory demands, phrasing structure, and intensity arc.\nThe individual stress response determines the set point, not the shape. S4 is 60 bpm below the other female singers but tracks the same contour as S3. S5 is 15 bpm above S1 but follows the same shape. K-MPAI predicts how high a singer’s HR is. The song determines when it rises and falls.\nThis helps explain the singer-panelist synchrony from Parts 8-10. The song drives a structured HR response in the singer. The panelists hear the same song. This likely accounts for the trend-level coherence concentrated at longer timescales: both singer and panelists respond to the musical arc, but through different mechanisms (respiratory demand vs. perceptual engagement)."

    "section": "Part 7: The S4-F3 Dyad and Panelist Patterns",
    "text": "Part 7: The S4-F3 Dyad and Panelist Patterns\n\nThe Singer 4 - Panelist 3 Relationship\nSinger 4 is a student of Panelist 3 – they have a pre-existing private studio teacher-student relationship. Panelist 1 also had prior classroom teaching experience with all five participants, though in a group setting rather than one-on-one. These relational contexts are important interpretive lenses, but cannot be isolated as causal explanations for Singer 4’s low HR. Several factors may contribute:\n\nSinger 4’s low HR is consistent with reduced evaluative threat. Performing for one’s own studio teacher – someone who knows your voice, has heard you at your worst, and is invested in your success – may reduce the sense that resources are insufficient to meet demands (the \"threat\" state in the biopsychosocial model; Guyon et al., 2020). However, the other singers also performed for a familiar classroom teacher (Panelist 1) without a comparable reduction, suggesting that the studio relationship’s intimacy may matter, or that individual differences in autonomic reactivity or coping style contribute independently.\nThe HR convergence between Singer 4 and Panelist 3 is consistent with what Coutinho et al. (2021) describe in established relationships. While Singer 4 and Panelist 3 are not romantic partners, the private studio relationship represents the closest interpersonal bond of any singer-panelist dyad in this study, and it produces the most convergent physiological profile.\nAll three panelists show elevated variability during Singer 4’s session. Panelist 3’s HR is the most variable of any session (sd=8.1 during the inter-song gap). Panelist 1 also shows its highest variability here (sd=5.8, spiking to ~113 bpm). Even Panelist 2, typically the most stable, shows slightly more variation.\n\nFor the thesis: This dyad should be discussed as both a limitation (the pre-existing relationships are confounds) and as a case study in co-regulation (the strongest evidence of physiological coupling occurs in the dyad with the deepest relational history). The explanation should be framed as one plausible factor rather than a confirmed mechanism, given that individual differences in autonomic reactivity or anxiolytic medication use (not screened for) could also account for Singer 4’s profile.\n\n\nAnticipatory Anxiety\nFour of five singers show pre-singing HR values of 126-143 bpm – substantially elevated above typical resting heart rate (60-80 bpm for young adults). This is consistent with Vellers et al. (2017), who identified the pre-performance anticipatory period as the most sensitive window for detecting audition stress. The singers are already in a state of sympathetic activation before they begin singing. Singer 4, again, is the exception at ~91 bpm.\n\n\nPanelist Anticipatory Activation\nThe singer anticipatory anxiety finding has a counterpart on the panelist side. All three panelists – seated throughout – show HR ramp-ups in the final seconds of the inter-song gap before song 2 begins. Because the panelists did not stand, shift position, or move during the auditions, these HR changes cannot be attributed to postural artifacts. They reflect genuine autonomic activation – the evaluative experience of preparing to hear the next piece.\nPanelist 3 shows the most consistent pattern (anticipatory activation in 4 of 5 sessions), with Session 4 (her own student) producing the largest ramp (+17.7 bpm). Panelist 1 shows activation in 3 of 5 sessions. Panelist 2, with the lowest overall HR, shows modest changes that are harder to distinguish from baseline fluctuation.\n\n\n                                                    \n\n\n\n\nPrepared vs. Assigned Song\nThe data does not show a simple pattern of \"assigned piece = more anxiety.\" Some singers (1, 3, 5) show higher HR during song 2 (assigned), but Singer 2 shows lower HR during song 2 than song 1. This may reflect:\n\nFatigue or habituation (HR naturally declining after sustained high effort)\nThe assigned piece being shorter and less demanding than some prepared pieces\nIndividual differences in how novelty vs. familiarity affects stress\n\nThe comparison is also confounded by order – song 2 always follows song 1, so any \"assigned piece\" effect is inseparable from a \"second performance\" effect. This should be acknowledged as a design limitation."

This addresses RQ1: does physiological coupling (synchrony) occur between singer and panelist during the audition?\n\nMethod\nFollowing Moulder et al. (2018), WCC was computed with: - Window: 10 seconds (captures meaningful HR fluctuation at 1 Hz) - Step: 5 seconds (50% overlap) - Max lag: +/-8 seconds (physiological response latency) - Primary metric: mean detrended Pearson r at lag 0\nWithin each window, both signals are linearly detrended before correlation. Windows where either signal has SD &lt; 0.5 bpm are excluded (the “near-constant guard,” primarily affecting Panelist 2).\nSurrogate testing: Each singer’s HR was paired with each panelist’s HR from other sessions (session-swap). This preserves temporal structure while breaking real coupling.\n\n\nPanelist 2 Exclusion Rate\nPanelist 2’s HR was near-constant in 95% of windows (188 of 198 excluded). Panelist 2 cannot contribute meaningful synchrony data, confirming the near-resting physiological state observed in Parts 1-2.\n\n\nWCC Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSinger\nPanelist 1 (mean r)\nPanelist 3 (mean r)\nPanelist 2 (mean r)\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nS1\n+0.23\n+0.23\n+0.04\nModerate positive synchrony\n\n\nS2\n+0.19\n-0.08\n-0.36\nPositive with Panelist 1 only\n\n\nS3\n+0.07\n-0.01\n+0.03\nNear zero across all panelists\n\n\nS4\n+0.36\n+0.03\n+0.45\nStrongest Panelist 1 coupling\n\n\nS5\n+0.03\n-0.15\nNaN\nPanelist 3 shows antiphase pattern\n\n\n\nKey observations:\n\nSinger 4 shows the strongest synchrony, but with Panelist 1, not Panelist 3. The S4-Panelist 1 pair has the highest mean r across both songs (+0.36), with particularly strong coupling during song_2 (r = +0.55). The studio teacher-student pair (S4-Panelist 3) shows near-zero coupling (+0.03).\nSinger 5 and Panelist 3 show the only consistent antiphase pattern (mean r = -0.15). Panelist 3’s HR tends to move opposite to Singer 5’s during performance.\nMost real pairs do not clearly exceed surrogates. With n = 5 and short song durations, statistical power is low. This question remains open for larger studies.\n\n\n\n                                                    \n\n\n\n\nSynchrony and K-MPAI\n\n\n\nComparison\nr_s\np\n\n\n\n\nK-MPAI vs Mean Sync (all panelists)\n-0.10\n0.873\n\n\nK-MPAI vs Sync with Panelist 1\n-0.30\n0.624\n\n\nK-MPAI vs Sync with Panelist 3\n-0.30\n0.624\n\n\nMAAQ Flex vs Mean Sync\n+0.10\n0.873\n\n\n\nNo meaningful relationship between trait anxiety and physiological synchrony.

No consistent pattern emerges: some pairs show higher synchrony during the prepared piece, others during the assigned piece. The short duration of Song 2 (~55-59 seconds) limits the number of WCC windows and makes these estimates noisier."

    "text": "Part 11: Full-Session Coherence (Pre-Singing Through Post-Session)\nParts 8-10 analyzed synchrony during the two song phases only. But the aligned HR data for each session spans five phases: pre-singing, song 1, inter-song gap, song 2, and post-session. The pre-singing phase captures anticipatory activation (singers at 126-143 bpm before singing a note), the inter-song gap captures panelist anticipatory ramps (Panelist 3 ramping +17.7 bpm before Singer 4’s second song), and the post-session phase captures any immediate recovery. These are some of the most interesting periods for co-regulation evidence, and they fall outside the song windows analyzed in Parts 8-10.\nWhy extend the analysis? The song-phase synchrony results (Parts 9-10) showed trend-level co-movement during active singing (mean smoothed r = +0.22, mean wavelet coherence = 0.489). But they couldn’t answer a critical question: is this co-movement part of a broader shared physiological arc across the entire audition, or is it specific to the performance period? If singer and panelist HR co-move before, during, and after singing, that strengthens the case for a shared autonomic response to the audition environment. If the co-movement is song-specific, the non-performance phases tell a different story.\nWhat we ran: Smoothed whole-series correlation and wavelet coherence on the full session time series (pre-singing through post-session) for each singer-panelist pair, with surrogate testing. WCC (Part 8) was not extended because the non-song phases are too short (pre-singing as brief as 17s, inter-song gap as brief as 18s) and WCC was already mostly null during the longer song phases.\n\nFull-Session Durations (per subject)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSession\nPre-Singing\nSong 1\nInter-Song Gap\nSong 2\nPost-Session\nTotal\n\n\n\n\nS1\n17s\n207s\n25s\n59s\n10s\n318s\n\n\nS2\n41s\n85s\n40s\n57s\n15s\n238s\n\n\nS3\n39s\n147s\n20s\n56s\n13s\n276s\n\n\nS4\n53s\n165s\n32s\n55s\n13s\n319s\n\n\nS5\n84s\n165s\n18s\n59s\n12s\n340s\n\n\n\n\n\nFull-Session Smoothed Correlation\n\n\n\nPair\nFull-Session r\nSong-Only Mean r\nDelta\n\n\n\n\nS1-F1\n+0.294\n-0.224\n+0.518\n\n\nS1-F3\n+0.450\n-0.202\n+0.651\n\n\nS2-F1\n-0.606\n-0.002\n-0.605\n\n\nS2-F3\n+0.198\n+0.771\n-0.573\n\n\nS3-F1\n-0.387\n+0.660\n-1.046\n\n\nS3-F3\n+0.185\n+0.439\n-0.254\n\n\nS4-F1\n-0.228\n-0.050\n-0.179\n\n\nS4-F3\n+0.082\n+0.386\n-0.304\n\n\nS5-F1\n+0.286\n+0.388\n-0.102\n\n\nS5-F3\n+0.487\n+0.451\n+0.036\n\n\n\nF2 omitted from table (near-constant HR within songs, though included in full-session analysis where slow drift produces higher variability).

Mean shift: -0.218.\nThe positive co-movement observed during songs collapses to near zero when the full session is analyzed. Song-only and full-session r values are essentially uncorrelated (r_s = +0.15, p = 0.594). The trend coherence during active singing is not part of a broader shared physiological arc. The anticipatory, transitional, and recovery phases introduce divergent patterns (asymmetric anticipatory responses, different recovery trajectories) that wash out the during-performance signal.\n\n\nFull-Session Wavelet Coherence\n\n\n\nPair\nFull-Session Coh.\nSong-Only Mean Coh.\nDelta\n\n\n\n\nS1-F1\n0.602\n0.427\n+0.175\n\n\nS1-F3\n0.521\n0.391\n+0.131\n\n\nS2-F1\n0.499\n0.419\n+0.081\n\n\nS2-F3\n0.566\n0.502\n+0.064\n\n\nS3-F1\n0.615\n0.679\n-0.064\n\n\nS3-F3\n0.508\n0.598\n-0.090\n\n\nS4-F1\n0.559\n0.451\n+0.108\n\n\nS4-F3\n0.513\n0.471\n+0.042\n\n\nS5-F1\n0.576\n0.451\n+0.125\n\n\nS5-F3\n0.563\n0.462\n+0.102\n\n\n\nMean full-session wavelet coherence: 0.565 (vs. song-only 0.489, +0.075 increase). Three of 15 pairs exceed 95% of surrogates.\nWavelet coherence moves in the opposite direction from smoothed correlation: it increases at the full-session level. This is not contradictory. Wavelet coherence captures coupling at specific timescales and time points, including the transitions between phases (onset of singing, inter-song gap, end of performance). These shared time-locked events boost coherence at specific scales even when the overall linear trend correlation is near zero.\n\n\nWhat This Tells Us\n\nLinear trend co-movement is song-specific. The mean positive correlation during songs (+0.220) disappears at the full-session level (+0.002). When a singer’s HR ramps up in anticipation, the panelists’ HR may or may not do the same, and the patterns differ across sessions.\nScale-specific coherence extends beyond songs. Coherence at 30s+ timescales persists and strengthens at the full-session level. The phase transitions themselves create shared time-locked events that register as coherence.\nThe distinction matters for co-regulation claims. The full-session results suggest something more modest than full-arc co-regulation: singer and panelists share a common response to the audition structure (event-locked coherence) and show directional co-movement during active singing (trend coherence), but neither pattern extends cleanly across the full session. This is consistent with a shared environmental response rather than direct interpersonal entrainment.\n\n\n\n                                                    \n\n\n\n\nFull-Session vs. Song-Only Comparison"

    "text": "Part 12: Limitations and Design Considerations\nThis section consolidates the study’s limitations. Per-analysis limitations are detailed within their respective parts.\n\nData resolution: HR was exported from Polar Flow at 1 Hz (averaged BPM per second), not beat-to-beat RR intervals. Standard HRV metrics cannot be computed. The 1 Hz resolution also limits within-window variability for WCC (Part 8), contributing to Panelist 2’s 95% exclusion rate.\nSample size: With 5 singers, Spearman correlations cannot reach p &lt; 0.05 unless the rank ordering is perfectly monotonic. All correlations are descriptive.\nPre-existing relationships: Panelist 3 is Singer 4’s studio voice teacher. Panelist 1 had prior classroom teaching experience with all five participants. These relational histories are confounds that cannot be fully separated from individual autonomic differences.\nNo medication screening: The study did not screen for beta blockers, SSRIs, or benzodiazepines, which could attenuate HR responses.\nOrder confound: Song 2 (assigned) always follows song 1 (prepared), so any assigned-piece effect is inseparable from a second-performance effect.\nGendered repertoire: Female and male singers sang different assigned pieces, limiting cross-gender comparison.\nNo pianist: All performances used backing tracks (unintentional but serves as a control).\nMultiple comparisons: Over 50 correlations computed across Parts 4-11. Even the one p = 0.037 result (K-MPAI x HR Range) would not survive Bonferroni correction."
