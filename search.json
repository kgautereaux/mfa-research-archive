    "text": "This analysis presents the heart rate data from five mock audition sessions. Each singer performed two songs — one prepared, one assigned 24 hours in advance — for a three-person faculty panel. All subjects wore Polar H10 heart rate monitors. HR was recorded at 1 Hz (one value per second) and aligned to audio using a clap-based sync point.\nParticipants:\nAssigned pieces: Female singers (S2, S3, S4): “If You Knew My Story” | Male singers (S1, S5): “Shiksa Goddess”\nData constraint: HR was exported from Polar Flow at 1 Hz — averaged BPM per second, not beat-to-beat RR intervals. Standard HRV metrics cannot be computed. Analysis focuses on HR magnitude, reactivity, and interpersonal synchrony."

    "section": "Part 1: Individual Session Time Series",
    "text": "Part 1: Individual Session Time Series\nEach figure shows one audition session with the singer’s HR (red) overlaid with Panelist 1’s HR (purple) and Panelist 3’s HR (blue). Shaded bands indicate audition phases. The x-axis shows elapsed time from the sync clap.\nPanelist baseline context: Panelist 1 runs consistently higher than Panelist 3 across all sessions — typically 98–108 bpm vs. F3’s 75–95 bpm. F1 is also more stable, with less variation across phases. The ~15–20 bpm gap between the two panelists is present in every session, suggesting a stable individual difference in resting autonomic tone rather than a differential response to specific singers.\n\nSession S1 — Singer 1 (M)\nSinger 1 begins around 127 bpm and ramps steadily upward through song 1 (prepared piece), reaching peaks near 160 bpm. There is a brief dip during the inter-song gap, followed by a sharp rise into song 2 (assigned piece), where HR reaches its highest sustained values (~155–158 bpm). Panelist 1 holds steady around 100–108 bpm; Panelist 3 remains lower at 85–95 bpm. Both panelists are flat and stable — the singer’s activation gap above the panelist mean is ~50–60 bpm during performance.\n\n\n        \n        \n        \n\n\n                            \n                                            \n\n\n\n\nSession S2 — Singer 2 (F)\nSinger 2 shows the steepest ramp-up of any singer — HR climbs from ~120 bpm at the start to peak near 169 bpm during song 1 (prepared). HR drops modestly during the inter-song gap (~145 bpm) but rebounds during song 2 (assigned), reaching ~155 bpm. Panelist 1 starts near 108 bpm and drifts down to ~100 bpm during song 1, then rises back toward 105 bpm in the post-session. Panelist 3 hovers lower in the 75–90 bpm range. The activation gap between singer and panelists widens as the session progresses.\n\n\n                            \n                                            \n\n\n\n\nSession S3 — Singer 3 (F)\nSinger 3 follows a similar arc to Singer 2 — gradual climb through the pre-singing phase, sustained elevation during song 1 (135–165 bpm), partial recovery in the gap, and a plateau during song 2 (~150–158 bpm). Panelist 1 is steady around 101–107 bpm; Panelist 3 is lower at 80–95 bpm. The inter-song gap shows a brief but noticeable HR spike in Panelist 3’s trace — likely anticipatory activation as the panelist prepares for the next performance.\n\n\n                            \n                                            \n\n\n\n\nSession S4 — Singer 4 (F)\nSinger 4 is a clear outlier. HR starts around 80–90 bpm in the pre-singing phase — within the range typically seen in a panelist, not a singer. During song 1, HR rises modestly to ~105–120 bpm, well below the 140–170 bpm range seen in other singers. During song 2, HR actually drops below baseline, reaching the mid-70s. This is the most visually striking session in the dataset: all three traces (singer, F1, F3) occupy the same vertical range (~75–115 bpm), with frequent crossing and intertwining. Panelist 1 holds around 97–103 bpm but spikes to ~113 bpm during the inter-song gap — the highest F1 variability in any session (sd=5.8). Panelist 3 is similarly variable (sd=8.1 during the gap), at times crossing above the singer’s HR.\nImportant context: Panelist 3 had a pre-existing teaching relationship with Singer 4. This likely explains the reduced anxiety response.\n\n\n                            \n                                            \n\n\n\n\nSession S5 — Singer 5 (M)\nSinger 5 shows the highest sustained HR of any participant. Starting from a pre-singing baseline of ~135–140 bpm (already elevated), HR climbs rapidly through song 1 to peaks near 184 bpm. The inter-song gap provides minimal recovery (~165 bpm), and song 2 drives HR to its highest sustained values (~170–180 bpm). Panelist 1 stays in the 96–106 bpm range; Panelist 3 is lower at 73–85 bpm. The widest activation gap in the study occurs here — ~80 bpm between singer and panelist mean during song 2."

    "section": "Part 2: Cross-Session Comparisons",
    "text": "Part 2: Cross-Session Comparisons\n\nSinger HR by Audition Phase\nThe grouped bar chart below shows each singer’s mean HR (with standard deviation bars) during the four performance phases. The pattern is consistent across four of five singers: HR is lowest during pre-singing, rises sharply for song 1, dips slightly during the inter-song gap, and remains elevated or continues rising into song 2. Singer 4 is the exception — her HR stays in the 88–106 bpm range across all phases, never approaching the 140+ bpm levels seen in the others.\nKey observation: Pre-singing baseline HR is remarkably similar across Singers 1, 2, 3, and 5 (~126–143 bpm), suggesting comparable levels of anticipatory anxiety before singing begins. Singer 4’s pre-singing HR (~91 bpm) is 35–50 bpm lower than the group.\n\n\n                            \n                                            \n\n\n\n\nSinger–Panelist Activation Gap\nThe chart below quantifies the HR difference between each singer and the mean of available panelists (Faculty 1 and Faculty 3) for each phase. The gap reflects how far the singer’s autonomic activation exceeds the panelists’ — a rough index of the anxiety asymmetry in the audition relationship.\nSingers 1, 2, 3, and 5 show gaps of 30–78 bpm, widening as the session progresses. The gap is largest during the inter-song gap and song 2 for most singers — suggesting that the stress of performing the assigned piece (less familiar, less rehearsed) compounds the already elevated state from song 1.\nSinger 4’s gap is negative in most phases — her HR falls below the panelist mean. This is the only singer whose physiological state approximates or drops beneath the panelists’.\n\n\n                            \n                                            \n\n\n\n\nHR Reactivity Profiles\nThe dot-and-line plot below connects each singer’s mean HR across the four phases, making the shape of each stress response visible.\nFour distinct profiles emerge:\n\nSinger 5 — highest absolute HR, steep climb, no recovery between songs. The most pronounced stress response in the study.\nSinger 2 — steep initial climb during song 1, partial recovery in the gap, rebound for song 2. Classic performance anxiety arc.\nSingers 1 and 3 — moderate, steady climb. Singer 1 shows the most gradual escalation; Singer 3 plateaus earlier.\nSinger 4 — flat trajectory near 90 bpm. Modest rise during song 1, return to baseline for song 2. This profile resembles a panelist more than a performer."
