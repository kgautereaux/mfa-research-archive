title: "MFA Vocal Pedagogy Research Archive"

## Welcome

This archive hosts interactive research from the MFA Vocal Pedagogy program. Each thesis project is documented with browsable analysis notebooks — complete with interactive figures you can hover, zoom, and explore.

The archive serves three purposes:

1. **For current students:** A living reference for how research moves from data to interpretation. Browse past projects to see methodological choices, analysis techniques, and how findings are communicated.

2. **For alumni:** A persistent home for your thesis research. Your interactive figures and analysis remain accessible after graduation.

3. **For the field:** A window into the kinds of questions vocal pedagogy researchers are asking and the methods they're using to answer them.
