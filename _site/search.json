    "text": "This analysis presents acoustic and perceptual data from a study comparing vocal exercises derived from animal imitations (owl, cat, cow) with exercises derived from the corresponding vowel imitations (/u/, /æ/, /ɑ/). Five participants each completed two sessions — one animal-based, one vowel-based — with acoustic measures extracted from mimics, exercises, and a target song (“Somewhere Over the Rainbow”) recorded at baseline and after each exercise block.\nAcoustic measures: f0, jitter, shimmer, HNR, intensity (calibrated), spectral moments (CoG, spectral SD, skewness, kurtosis), CPPS, H1-H2, F1, F2, alpha ratio, L/H ratio, LTAS slope/tilt, AVQI.\nPerceptual measure: Omni-VES (Vocal Effort Scale), rated by researcher and participant self-assessment.\nStatistical approach: Cohen’s d with bootstrapped 95% CIs, Spearman rank correlations. Emphasis on effect sizes and patterns over p-values given n = 5.\nFormant caveat: Formant estimation is unreliable when f0 exceeds ~350 Hz. Owl mimics (~570 Hz) and “where” targets (~520 Hz) are flagged; cat mimics (~430 Hz) are borderline; cow mimics (~320 Hz) and “some” targets (~260 Hz) are reliable."

Positive values (blue) mean the animal mimic scored higher; negative values (red) mean the vowel mimic scored higher.\nThree distinct acoustic signatures emerge:\n\nCow changes phonation: HNR d = +3.91, f0 SD d = −2.55, lower perturbation across the board. The cow sound invites a fundamentally different way of using the voice compared to singing /ɑ/ — more modal, more stable, lower pitch.\nCat changes resonance and spectrum: spectral SD d = +3.21, F2 d = +2.78, CoG d = +1.93. The meow concentrates energy in the upper spectrum in a way that singing /æ/ does not.\nOwl changes intensity and stability: intensity d = +2.57, shimmer dB d = −2.13. The owl hoo is essentially a more projected, more stable version of the vowel.\n\nThis is the most robust finding in the study. The effect sizes are very large (d &gt; 2 for multiple measures across all three pairs) and consistent within pairs."

This divergence suggests that the motor learning happening across repetitions is itself condition-dependent — the animal mimic seeds a vocal pattern that evolves as the singer repeats the exercise.\nOther observations: - Cat H1-H2 shows parallel downward trends — both conditions become more pressed, but the cat-derived exercise starts from a higher baseline. - Alpha ratio diverges for Cow but not for Cat or Owl, consistent with Cow’s phonation-domain effect. - Jitter is generally stable across reps, with the animal condition lower (less perturbed) for Cow and Owl."

    "section": "Qualitative Observations",
    "text": "Qualitative Observations\nThe researcher (Morgan) recorded observations on strain/tension, breath support, resonance/placement, and general impressions for every segment across all 10 sessions. These observations ground the acoustic findings in the language voice teachers actually use.\n\nThemes by Animal-Vowel Pair\nOwl / /u/ — “Ease,” “lofted space,” “relaxed”\nThe owl mimic consistently elicited the most positive quality language. Descriptions include: “none to be heard” (re: strain), “a good amount of release and ease,” “good lofted, back mouth space,” and “all four reps are very similar in timbre, pitch, breath control.” The owl exercises continued this pattern: “still sounded easeful,” “relatively free, easy, relaxed vibrato and breath.” Acoustically, this maps to low perturbation, high intensity, and spectrally narrow output.\nCat / /æ/ — “Twang/ping,” “pressing,” “constriction”\nThe cat mimic produced mixed observations — positive resonance features alongside effortful production: “some good ping starting to develop” but also “some tightness potentially around the larynx/pharynx” and “some pharyngeal constriction.” Multiple participants naturally produced an /m/ onset, reflecting the natural onset of “meow.” Acoustically, this maps to high spectral SD, high CoG, and high F2 — the meow engages M2 resonance but sometimes through effort rather than ease.\nCow / /ɑ/ — “Vocal fry,” “pressing in fry,” “registration breaks”\nThe cow mimic is defined by registration traversal — chest voice through fry into head voice. Notes consistently flag: “some strain in the fry/chest,” “brightness in the chest/warmth in the head — not much connection throughout,” and “fry to M2 to fry.” The exercises show the pattern continuing: “seems to be some pressing at the vocal fold level here.” This maps to the HNR/f0 SD/perturbation pattern, and the H1-H2 divergence across reps.\n\n\n“Somewhere” Trajectory — What the Listener Heard\nDespite noisy group-level acoustic data, the researcher consistently perceived progressive improvement:\n\nP1: Baseline “some adduction issues” → Post-Cow “less overall tension, better phrasing, more focus and ping, seems to be an improvement in overall function”\nP2: Baseline “some slight strain on ascending leaps” → Post-Cow “much more ease in transition areas, the connection between the larger leaps were very successful”\nP4: Baseline “slight strain on ascending leaps” → Post-Cow “the least amount of strain yet! Registration is connected, best take yet!”\nP5: Baseline “excessive airy quality due to hypofunction” → Post-Cat “we can hear the mechanism making adjustments here in real time”\n\nBoth protocols appear to warm up the voice and build coordination. The kind of improvement may differ — the animal session developing more M2 access and registration connection, the vowel session developing more breath flow and release — but both trajectories point toward improved function."

    "text": "This analysis presents the heart rate data from five mock audition sessions. Each singer performed two songs – one prepared, one assigned 24 hours in advance – for a three-person faculty panel. All subjects wore Polar H10 heart rate monitors. HR was recorded at 1 Hz (one value per second) and aligned to audio using a clap-based sync point.\nParticipants:\nAssigned pieces: Female singers (S2, S3, S4): “If You Knew My Story” | Male singers (S1, S5): “Shiksa Goddess”\nData constraint: HR was exported from Polar Flow at 1 Hz – averaged BPM per second, not beat-to-beat RR intervals. Standard HRV metrics cannot be computed. Analysis focuses on HR magnitude, reactivity, and interpersonal synchrony.\nMethodological notes: - All faculty panelists were seated throughout all auditions. No standing, walking, or postural changes occurred. All panelist HR variations reflect genuine autonomic responses, not movement artifacts. - Panelist 1 wore a facial mask for the duration of the experiment to avoid sharing or receiving illness. This may have contributed slightly to Panelist 1’s elevated baseline HR (~100 bpm), though the consistency across all five sessions suggests a stable individual difference rather than a masking artifact."

    "text": "Part 1: Individual Session Time Series\nEach figure shows one audition session with the singer’s HR (red) overlaid with Panelist 1 (purple), Panelist 2 (green), and Panelist 3 (blue). Shaded bands indicate audition phases.\nPanelist baseline context: The three panelists – all seated throughout – show a stable hierarchy across all sessions: Panelist 1 runs highest (~98-108 bpm), Panelist 3 is moderate (~75-95 bpm), and Panelist 2 is lowest (~55-65 bpm). Panelist 2’s HR is essentially resting heart rate for a seated adult. These individual differences in resting autonomic tone are consistent across all five sessions, suggesting stable trait-level variation rather than differential responses to specific singers.\n\nSession 1 – Singer 1 (M)\nSinger 1 begins around 127 bpm and ramps steadily upward through song 1 (prepared piece), reaching peaks near 160 bpm. There is a brief dip during the inter-song gap, followed by a sharp rise into song 2 (assigned piece), where HR reaches its highest sustained values (~155-158 bpm). The three panelists hold flat: Panelist 1 around 100-108 bpm, Panelist 3 at 85-95 bpm, and Panelist 2 near 58 bpm. The singer’s activation gap above the panelist mean is ~60-70 bpm during performance.\n\n\n                                                    \n\n\n\n\nSession 2 – Singer 2 (F)\nSinger 2 shows the steepest ramp-up of any singer – HR climbs from ~120 bpm at the start to peak near 169 bpm during song 1 (prepared). HR drops modestly during the inter-song gap (~145 bpm) but rebounds during song 2 (assigned), reaching ~155 bpm. Panelist 1 drifts from 108 down to ~100 bpm; Panelist 3 hovers in the 75-90 bpm range; Panelist 2 holds steady near 57 bpm. The activation gap widens as the session progresses.\n\n\n                                                    \n\n\n\n\nSession 3 – Singer 3 (F)\nSinger 3 follows a similar arc to Singer 2 – gradual climb through the pre-singing phase, sustained elevation during song 1 (135-165 bpm), partial recovery in the gap, and a plateau during song 2 (~150-158 bpm). Panelist 1 is steady around 101-107 bpm; Panelist 3 is at 80-95 bpm; Panelist 2 stays near 58-60 bpm. The inter-song gap shows a brief but noticeable HR spike in Panelist 3’s trace – likely anticipatory activation as the panelist prepares for the next performance (see Panelist Anticipatory Activation below).\n\n\n                                                    \n\n\n\n\nSession 4 – Singer 4 (F)\nSinger 4 is a clear outlier. HR starts around 80-90 bpm in the pre-singing phase – within the range typically seen in a panelist, not a singer. During song 1, HR rises modestly to ~105-120 bpm, well below the 140-170 bpm range seen in other singers. During song 2, HR actually drops below baseline, reaching the mid-70s. This is the most visually striking session in the dataset: the singer’s trace overlaps with Panelist 1 and Panelist 3, while Panelist 2 runs below all of them. Panelist 1 spikes to ~113 bpm during the inter-song gap – the highest F1 variability in any session (sd=5.8). Panelist 3 is similarly variable (sd=8.1 during the gap).\nImportant context: Panelist 3 had a pre-existing private studio teaching relationship with Singer 4. Panelist 1 had previously taught all five participants in a classroom setting. Singer 4’s reduced HR may reflect the familiarity of the studio teacher-student relationship, individual differences in autonomic reactivity, anxiolytic medication use (not screened for), or some combination.\n\n\n                                                    \n\n\n\n\nSession 5 – Singer 5 (M)\nSinger 5 shows the highest sustained HR of any participant. Starting from a pre-singing baseline of ~135-140 bpm (already elevated), HR climbs rapidly through song 1 to peaks near 184 bpm. The inter-song gap provides minimal recovery (~165 bpm), and song 2 drives HR to its highest sustained values (~170-180 bpm). The three panelists form a clear floor: Panelist 1 at 96-106 bpm, Panelist 3 at 73-85 bpm, Panelist 2 at 54-59 bpm. The widest activation gap in the study occurs here – ~91 bpm between singer and the 3-panelist mean during song 2."

    "text": "Part 2: Cross-Session Comparisons\n\nSinger HR by Audition Phase\nThe grouped bar chart below shows each singer’s mean HR (with standard deviation bars) during the four performance phases. The pattern is consistent across four of five singers: HR is lowest during pre-singing, rises sharply for song 1, dips slightly during the inter-song gap, and remains elevated or continues rising into song 2. Singer 4 is the exception – her HR stays in the 88-106 bpm range across all phases, never approaching the 140+ bpm levels seen in the others.\nKey observation: Pre-singing baseline HR is remarkably similar across Singers 1, 2, 3, and 5 (~126-143 bpm), suggesting comparable levels of anticipatory anxiety before singing begins. Singer 4’s pre-singing HR (~91 bpm) is 35-50 bpm lower than the group.\n\n\n                                                    \n\n\n\n\nSinger-Panelist Activation Gap\nThe chart below quantifies the HR difference between each singer and the mean of all three panelists for each phase. The gap reflects how far the singer’s autonomic activation exceeds the panelists’ – a rough index of the anxiety asymmetry in the audition relationship. With Panelist 2 included (mean HR ~58 bpm, seated), the 3-panelist average is lower than the earlier 2-panelist estimate, so activation gaps are wider.\nSingers 1, 2, 3, and 5 show gaps of 38-91 bpm, widening as the session progresses. The gap is largest during the inter-song gap and song 2 for most singers – suggesting that the stress of performing the assigned piece (less familiar, less rehearsed) compounds the already elevated state from song 1.\nSinger 4’s gap is small but positive (+8 bpm during song 2) – her HR stays close to the panelist range. This is the only singer whose physiological state approximates the panelists’.\n\n\n                                                    \n\n\n\n\nHR Reactivity Profiles\nThe dot-and-line plot below connects each singer’s mean HR across the four phases, making the shape of each stress response visible.\nFour distinct profiles emerge:\n\nSinger 5 – highest absolute HR, steep climb, no recovery between songs. The most pronounced stress response in the study.\nSinger 2 – steep initial climb during song 1, partial recovery in the gap, rebound for song 2. Classic performance anxiety arc.\nSingers 1 and 3 – moderate, steady climb. Singer 1 shows the most gradual escalation; Singer 3 plateaus earlier.\nSinger 4 – flat trajectory near 90 bpm. Modest rise during song 1, return to baseline for song 2. This profile resembles a panelist more than a performer.\n\n\n\n                                                    \n\n\n\n\nNormalized HR Trajectories\nAll five singers’ HR traces plotted on a common timeline, each zeroed to their own pre-singing baseline mean. This removes differences in resting HR and shows the magnitude of change from baseline.\nWith a 10-second rolling average for readability:\n\nSingers 2 and 5 show the largest sustained elevations (~25-40 bpm above baseline).\nSinger 1 shows a moderate, steady rise (~15-30 bpm above baseline).\nSinger 3 shows a moderate rise with more variability.\nSinger 4 shows the smallest reactivity – peaking around +15 bpm during song 1, then dropping below baseline during song 2."

    "section": "Part 4: Interpretive Notes",
    "text": "Part 4: Interpretive Notes\n\nThe Singer 4 - Panelist 3 Relationship\nSinger 4 is a student of Panelist 3 – they have a pre-existing private studio teacher-student relationship. Panelist 1 also had prior classroom teaching experience with all five participants, though in a group setting rather than one-on-one. These relational contexts are important interpretive lenses, but cannot be isolated as causal explanations for Singer 4’s low HR. Several factors may contribute:\n\nSinger 4’s low HR is consistent with reduced evaluative threat. Performing for one’s own studio teacher – someone who knows your voice, has heard you at your worst, and is invested in your success – may reduce the sense that resources are insufficient to meet demands (the \"threat\" state in the biopsychosocial model; Guyon et al., 2020). However, the other singers also performed for a familiar classroom teacher (Panelist 1) without a comparable reduction, suggesting that the studio relationship’s intimacy may matter, or that individual differences in autonomic reactivity or coping style contribute independently.\nThe HR convergence between Singer 4 and Panelist 3 is consistent with what Coutinho et al. (2021) describe in established relationships. While Singer 4 and Panelist 3 are not romantic partners, the private studio relationship represents the closest interpersonal bond of any singer-panelist dyad in this study, and it produces the most convergent physiological profile.\nAll three panelists show elevated variability during Singer 4’s session. Panelist 3’s HR is the most variable of any session (sd=8.1 during the inter-song gap). Panelist 1 also shows its highest variability here (sd=5.8, spiking to ~113 bpm). Even Panelist 2, typically the most stable, shows slightly more variation.\n\nFor the thesis: This dyad should be discussed as both a limitation (the pre-existing relationships are confounds) and as a case study in co-regulation (the strongest evidence of physiological coupling occurs in the dyad with the deepest relational history). The explanation should be framed as one plausible factor rather than a confirmed mechanism, given that individual differences in autonomic reactivity or anxiolytic medication use (not screened for) could also account for Singer 4’s profile.\n\n\nAnticipatory Anxiety\nFour of five singers show pre-singing HR values of 126-143 bpm – substantially elevated above typical resting heart rate (60-80 bpm for young adults). This is consistent with Vellers et al. (2017), who identified the pre-performance anticipatory period as the most sensitive window for detecting audition stress. The singers are already in a state of sympathetic activation before they begin singing. Singer 4, again, is the exception at ~91 bpm.\n\n\nPanelist Anticipatory Activation\nThe singer anticipatory anxiety finding has a counterpart on the panelist side. All three panelists – seated throughout – show HR ramp-ups in the final seconds of the inter-song gap before song 2 begins. Because the panelists did not stand, shift position, or move during the auditions, these HR changes cannot be attributed to postural artifacts. They reflect genuine autonomic activation – the evaluative experience of preparing to hear the next piece.\nPanelist 3 shows the most consistent pattern (anticipatory activation in 4 of 5 sessions), with Session 4 (her own student) producing the largest ramp (+17.7 bpm). Panelist 1 shows activation in 3 of 5 sessions. Panelist 2, with the lowest overall HR, shows modest changes that are harder to distinguish from baseline fluctuation.\n\n\n                                                    \n\n\n\n\nPrepared vs. Assigned Song\nThe data does not show a simple pattern of \"assigned piece = more anxiety.\" Some singers (1, 3, 5) show higher HR during song 2 (assigned), but Singer 2 shows lower HR during song 2 than song 1. This may reflect:\n\nFatigue or habituation (HR naturally declining after sustained high effort)\nThe assigned piece being shorter and less demanding than some prepared pieces\nIndividual differences in how novelty vs. familiarity affects stress\n\nThe comparison is also confounded by order – song 2 always follows song 1, so any \"assigned piece\" effect is inseparable from a \"second performance\" effect. This should be acknowledged as a design limitation."

    "text": "K-MPAI and MAAQ Pre-Survey Results\nThe K-MPAI was administered to all BoCo BFA/MM voice students as a pre-screening survey. The 5 study participants were drawn from this broader pool of 26 respondents. Scoring follows Kenny (2009): 40 items on a 0-6 scale with 8 reverse-coded positive items (1, 2, 9, 17, 23, 33, 35, 37), range 0-240, clinical threshold &gt;=105.\n\n\n                                                    \n\n\nPopulation (26 BoCo singer respondents):\n\nMean K-MPAI: 124.1 (SD 31.6), Median: 124.0, Range: 64-185\n73% (19/26) score &gt;=105 (clinically significant MPA)\nThis is a high-anxiety population, consistent with conservatory performance culture\n\n\n\n                                                    \n\n\nStudy participants:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSinger\nK-MPAI\nClinical?\nMAAQ Flexibility\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nS1 (M)\n126\nYes\n31\nNear population mean\n\n\nS2 (F)\n111\nYes\n35 (highest)\nLowest anxiety, highest flexibility\n\n\nS3 (F)\n144\nYes\n26\nAbove population mean\n\n\nS4 (F)\n159\nYes\n21\nHigh anxiety despite lowest HR\n\n\nS5 (M)\n174\nYes\n17 (lowest)\nHighest anxiety, lowest flexibility\n\n\n\nAll 5 singers score above the clinical threshold – not surprising given they self-selected for a study on performance anxiety. The rank ordering is notable: Singer 5 (highest K-MPAI, 174) also shows the highest sustained HR in the study, while Singer 2 (lowest K-MPAI, 111) shows the steepest HR ramp-up but also the most recovery between songs. Singer 4 (K-MPAI 159 – second highest) is the most interesting case: high self-reported anxiety with the lowest physiological response. Several factors may contribute, including the studio relationship with Panelist 3, individual autonomic differences, or anxiolytic medication (not screened for in this study).\nFaculty panelists:\n\n\n\nPanelist\nK-MPAI\nClinical?\nMAAQ Flexibility\nMean HR (seated)\n\n\n\n\nPanelist 1\n109 (2 items missing)\nYes\n24\n~101 bpm\n\n\nPanelist 2\n102\nNo\n33\n~58 bpm\n\n\nPanelist 3\n169\nYes\n32\n~85 bpm\n\n\n\nPanelist 3’s K-MPAI (169) is notably high – higher than any study participant except Singer 5. For a panelist whose own performance anxiety is elevated, evaluating singers (especially her own student, Singer 4) may carry additional physiological weight. Panelist 2 falls just below the clinical threshold at 102 and shows the lowest HR of anyone in the study – essentially resting heart rate while seated. The K-MPAI ranking on the faculty side (F3 &gt; F1 &gt; F2) does not map directly to their HR ranking (F1 &gt; F3 &gt; F2), but Panelist 2 being the calmest on both measures is consistent.\nLimitation: The study did not screen for anxiolytic medication use (beta blockers, SSRIs, benzodiazepines) in singers or faculty panelists. Any participant using such medication could show attenuated HR responses that do not reflect their underlying anxiety level.\n\nK-MPAI Scoring Note\nThe Qualtrics-generated SC0 score differs from our computed score by a constant of +40 across all 26 respondents (verified: identical SDs, perfect rank correlation). Qualtrics scores the K-MPAI on a 1-7 internal scale, while Kenny (2009) specifies 0-6. Both apply the same reverse coding on the same 8 items – the only difference is a +1 shift per item across all 40 items (40 x 1 = 40). We use the published 0-6 convention. The Qualtrics threshold equivalent of &gt;=105 is &gt;=145."

    "text": "Part 5: Anxiety Measures x Heart Rate Correlations\n\nK-MPAI x Heart Rate (RQ2)\nDoes higher trait performance anxiety predict higher physiological arousal during the audition? With n = 5 singers, Spearman rank correlations are used. The critical value for significance at p &lt; 0.05 (two-tailed) with n = 5 is |r_s| = 1.000, so no correlation can reach conventional significance.

Singer 4’s position breaks any monotonic pattern: she has the second-highest K-MPAI (159) but the lowest HR across every measure. If Singer 4 were removed, the remaining four singers show a near-monotonic positive relationship between K-MPAI and Mean Song HR. Several factors may contribute to Singer 4’s low HR: the pre-existing studio teaching relationship with Panelist 3, individual differences in autonomic reactivity, or anxiolytic medication use (not screened for in this study). With n = 5, a single case can shift the entire correlation.\n\n\n                                                    \n\n\n\n\nPost-Survey x Heart Rate Correlations\n\nSinger Self-Report\nSingers completed an 8-item post-performance survey (1-5 Likert) immediately after their audition. Each item is correlated with their mean song HR.\nCritical finding: “Felt anxious” has zero variance. All five singers rated their anxiety at 4 out of 5. With no rank-order variance, the correlation is undefined. This is itself a substantive result: every singer, including Singer 4 (whose HR was near panelist levels), self-reported high anxiety. The audition context produced a universal subjective experience of anxiety regardless of the physiological response, consistent with research showing that cognitive and somatic anxiety components can dissociate.\n\n\n\nSurvey Item\nDirection\nvs Mean Song HR (r_s)\n\n\n\n\nFelt confident\npositive\n+0.35\n\n\nFelt anxious\nnegative\nNaN (no variance)\n\n\nFelt authentic\npositive\n0.00\n\n\nFelt safe to express\npositive\n0.00\n\n\nEmotionally connected\npositive\n+0.78\n\n\nEmotionally disconnected\nnegative\n-0.05\n\n\nEnjoyed performing\npositive\n+0.37\n\n\nDid not feel satisfaction\nnegative\n+0.63\n\n\n\n“Emotionally connected” shows the strongest positive correlation with HR (r_s = +0.78, p = 0.118). Singers with higher HR reported feeling more emotionally connected to their performance, not less. This is consistent with the idea that physiological activation during performance is not purely aversive: it can coexist with engagement and emotional presence.\n\n\nFaculty Perception x Singer HR\nFaculty panelists rated each singer on 6 items after each audition (n = 15 observations: 3 panelists x 5 singers, not independent). These ratings were correlated with both singer HR and the panelist’s own HR during that session.\n\n\n\nFaculty Item\nvs Singer Mean HR (r_s)\nvs Panelist Own HR (r_s)\n\n\n\n\nAppeared confident\n+0.50 (p=.057)\n-0.14\n\n\nShowed signs of anxiety\n-0.40 (p=.138)\n-0.12\n\n\nFelt authentic\n-0.03\n-0.20\n\n\nEmotionally connected\n-0.07\n-0.03\n\n\nEmotionally disconnected\n-0.09\n+0.12\n\n\nAppeared to enjoy performing\n+0.34\n+0.02\n\n\n\nPanelists rated singers with higher HR as appearing more confident, not less (r_s = +0.50, p = 0.057). And they rated singers with higher HR as showing fewer signs of anxiety (r_s = -0.40). This is driven by Singer 4 (lowest HR) receiving some of the highest anxiety ratings, while Singer 5 (highest HR) received the lowest anxiety ratings from two of three panelists. Physiological stress was not visible to the panelists.\nPanelist own HR shows no meaningful correlation with any perception item. What panelists felt physiologically did not predict how they rated the singer.\n\n\n                                                    \n\n\n\n\n\nData Pending\n\nExploratory analyses (Phase 4) – individual case studies, panelist convergence, audition order effects."

    "text": "Part 6: HR Trajectory Features and Individual Growth Curves\nThe mean-level correlations in Part 5 collapse each singer’s entire song performance into a single HR value. This section preserves temporal structure by extracting trajectory features from HR time series during each song phase and fitting individual growth curves.\n\nTrajectory Features\nFive features were extracted from each singer’s HR during song_1 and song_2, then averaged across both songs:\n\nSlope: linear regression slope of HR over normalized time (0 = song onset, 1 = song offset). Using normalized time avoids a confound with song duration.\nAUC above baseline: area under the HR curve above the singer’s pre-singing baseline HR, normalized by duration (bpm above resting).\nTime to Peak: seconds from phase start to maximum HR\nHR Range: max minus min HR within the phase (amplitude of fluctuation)\nRecovery: HR at phase end minus HR at phase start (positive = continued climbing, negative = recovery)\n\n\n\n\nFeature\nK-MPAI r_s\np\nMAAQ Flex. r_s\np\n\n\n\n\nSlope (bpm/norm. time)\n+0.70\n0.188\n-0.70\n0.188\n\n\nAUC above baseline (bpm)\n-0.30\n0.624\n+0.30\n0.624\n\n\nTime to Peak\n+0.30\n0.624\n-0.30\n0.624\n\n\nHR Range\n+0.90\n0.037\n-0.90\n0.037\n\n\nRecovery\n+0.70\n0.188\n-0.70\n0.188\n\n\n\nKey findings:\n\nHR Range is the strongest trajectory-anxiety association (r_s = +0.90, p = 0.037, uncorrected). Higher trait anxiety predicts wider HR fluctuation during singing. Slope and Recovery also show positive associations with K-MPAI (r_s = +0.70 each) but do not reach conventional significance. These trajectory features reveal information that mean HR obscures. Unlike the near-zero K-MPAI x Mean Song HR correlation (r_s = +0.10), the trajectory features capture the dynamic quality of the stress response.\n\nNote: All p-values are uncorrected for multiple comparisons. Across the full analysis, over 50 correlations are computed. Even the one p = 0.037 result (HR Range) would not survive Bonferroni correction. All correlations should be treated as exploratory pattern descriptions.\n\nSinger 4 no longer breaks the pattern for HR Range. In the mean HR analyses, Singer 4’s low absolute HR (despite high K-MPAI) produced flat correlations. But Singer 4’s range is actually consistent with moderate-to-high K-MPAI: she shows meaningful HR fluctuation (23-40 bpm range) even though her absolute HR stays low. The trajectory features reveal that Singer 4’s autonomic system is responding to the performance, just from a lower set point.\nRecovery is positive for all singers. No singer shows net HR recovery within either song phase. All singers’ HR is still climbing or elevated at the end of each song.\n\n\n\n                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                                                    \n\n\n\n\nIndividual Growth Curves\nFor each singer and song phase, HR was modeled over normalized time (0 = song onset, 1 = song offset) using both linear and quadratic regression. The quadratic fit captures inverted-U or U-shaped trajectories that a linear model would miss.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSinger\nSong\nShape\nLinear R2\nQuad R2\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nS1\nPrepared\nRamp-up\n0.852\n0.861\nSteady linear climb\n\n\nS1\nAssigned\nRamp-up\n0.733\n0.736\nSteady linear climb\n\n\nS2\nPrepared\nInverted-U\n0.044\n0.913\nClassic arc: rise then fall\n\n\nS2\nAssigned\nRamp-up\n0.353\n0.384\nShifts to climb pattern for new piece\n\n\nS3\nPrepared\nInverted-U\n0.739\n0.794\nRise with late plateau\n\n\nS3\nAssigned\nInverted-U\n0.418\n0.599\nModerate arc\n\n\nS4\nPrepared\nInverted-U\n0.013\n0.428\nRise and fall within panelist range\n\n\nS4\nAssigned\nRamp-up\n0.889\n0.889\nPure linear climb from low baseline\n\n\nS5\nPrepared\nInverted-U\n0.797\n0.894\nSteep climb with late plateau near 180 bpm\n\n\nS5\nAssigned\nU-shape\n0.799\n0.902\nBrief early dip then steep climb\n\n\n\nInterpretive notes:\n\nS2 prepared piece is the most dramatic inverted-U (R2 improvement = +0.87). A linear model explains almost nothing (R2 = 0.04), while the quadratic captures 91% of variance.\nThe prepared-to-assigned shift changes trajectory shape. Three singers (S2, S4, S5) show different shapes between songs. The assigned piece may not allow enough time or familiarity for the downslope of the inverted-U to emerge.\nS1 is the most consistently linear. Both songs show high linear R2 (0.73-0.85) with negligible quadratic improvement."

    "text": "Part 7: Physiological Synchrony (Windowed Cross-Correlation)\nThis section quantifies the degree to which singer and panelist HR move together during performance, using windowed cross-correlation (WCC). This addresses RQ1: does physiological coupling (synchrony) occur between singer and panelist during the audition?\n\nMethod\nFollowing Moulder et al. (2018), WCC was computed with: - Window: 10 seconds (captures meaningful HR fluctuation at 1 Hz) - Step: 5 seconds (50% overlap) - Max lag: +/-8 seconds (physiological response latency) - Primary metric: mean detrended Pearson r at lag 0\nWithin each window, both signals are linearly detrended before correlation. Windows where either signal has SD &lt; 0.5 bpm are excluded (the “near-constant guard,” primarily affecting Panelist 2).\nSurrogate testing: Each singer’s HR was paired with each panelist’s HR from other sessions (session-swap). This preserves temporal structure while breaking real coupling.\n\n\nPanelist 2 Exclusion Rate\nPanelist 2’s HR was near-constant in 95% of windows (188 of 198 excluded).

No consistent pattern emerges: some pairs show higher synchrony during the prepared piece, others during the assigned piece. The short duration of Song 2 (~55-59 seconds) limits the number of WCC windows and makes these estimates noisier."
