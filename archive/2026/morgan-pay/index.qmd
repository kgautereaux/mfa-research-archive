## Abstract

This study investigates how vocal exercises derived from animal imitations (owl, cat, cow) and phoneme imitations (/u/, /ae/, /a/) affect singing voice quality, measured both acoustically and perceptually.

## Study Design

- 5 participants, each recorded in 2 sessions
- **Session A** — animal mimic protocol: owl, cat, cow imitations → derived exercises → song
- **Session B** — vowel/phoneme mimic protocol: /u/, /ae/, /a/, /ae/-/u/ → derived exercises → song
- Target song: "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" — recorded pre-session and after each exercise block
- Perceptual evaluation: Omni-VES
- Acoustic measures: f0, jitter, shimmer, HNR, intensity (calibrated), CoG, spectral SD, skewness, kurtosis, CPPS, H1-H2, F1, F2, alpha ratio, L/H ratio, LTAS slope/tilt, AVQI

## Analysis Notebooks

| Notebook | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [Acoustic Analysis: Animal vs. Vowel Mimic Exercises](analysis.ipynb) | Effect sizes by pair, mimic-to-exercise transfer, rep-by-rep trajectories, carry-over, VES correlations, AVQI |

## Key Findings (Preliminary)

- Each animal mimic invites a different vocal adjustment: cow changes phonation, cat changes resonance/spectrum, owl changes intensity/stability
- Effect sizes are very large (d > 2 for multiple measures across all three pairs)
- Transfer from mimic to exercise is partial and pair-dependent — cat spectral features transfer best
- Neither protocol harms overall voice quality (AVQI stable or improved)
- Perceived quality (VES) is vowel-dependent and functions more as a task demand scale than a voice quality scale
