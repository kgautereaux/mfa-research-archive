## Abstract

This study investigates how vocal exercises derived from animal imitations (owl, cat, cow) and phoneme imitations (/u/, /ae/, /a/) affect singing voice quality, measured both acoustically and perceptually.

## Study Design

- 5 participants, each recorded in 2 sessions
- **Session A** — animal mimic protocol: owl, cat, cow imitations → derived exercises → song
- **Session B** — vowel/phoneme mimic protocol: /u/, /ae/, /a/, /ae/-/u/ → derived exercises → song
- Target song: "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" — recorded pre-session and after each exercise block
- Perceptual evaluation: Omni-VES
- Acoustic measures: AVQI, DSI, CPPS, HNR, shimmer, jitter, f0

## Analysis Notebooks

*Coming soon — analysis notebooks will be added as the project progresses.*
