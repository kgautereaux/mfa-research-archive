## Abstract

This study examines performance anxiety in the vocal audition through continuous heart rate monitoring of both singers and faculty panelists. Five singer-participants performed two songs each — one prepared and one assigned 24 hours in advance — for a three-person faculty panel. All subjects wore Polar H10 heart rate monitors throughout the session.

## Study Design

**Participants:**

- 5 singers (3 female, 2 male)
- 3 faculty panelists

**Protocol:**

Each singer performed a mock audition consisting of:

1. **Pre-singing phase** — time between sync clap and first note
2. **Song 1** — prepared piece (singer's choice)
3. **Inter-song gap** — transition between songs
4. **Song 2** — assigned piece (given 24 hours prior)
5. **Post-session** — after final note

**Measures:**

- Continuous HR (Polar H10, 1 Hz export)
- K-MPAI (Kenny Music Performance Anxiety Inventory)
- MAAQ (Music Audition Anxiety Questionnaire)
- Post-performance Qualtrics surveys (separate singer/panelist versions)

**Assigned pieces:**

- Female singers: "If You Knew My Story"
- Male singers: "Shiksa Goddess"

## Analysis

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [Heart Rate During the Mock Audition](03_descriptive.ipynb) | Per-session HR time series, cross-session comparisons, same-song overlays, K-MPAI results, and interpretive notes |

## Key Findings (Preliminary)

- Four of five singers showed HR elevations of 16–32 bpm above their pre-singing baseline during performance
- The singer–panelist activation gap widens as sessions progress, reaching 56–80 bpm during the assigned song
- One singer (S4) showed a flat HR profile resembling a panelist — her voice teacher was on the panel, producing the strongest evidence of physiological coupling in the dataset
- The assigned piece (less rehearsed, given 24 hrs prior) did not consistently produce higher HR than the prepared piece, but recovery between songs was minimal
- 73% of the BoCo singer population (19/26) scored above the clinical threshold on the K-MPAI
- Panelists show anticipatory activation (HR ramp-ups) in the seconds before song 2 begins — their physiology is not inert during the audition

## Data Note

HR data was exported from Polar Flow at 1 Hz (one BPM value per second). This is averaged data, not beat-to-beat RR intervals — standard HRV metrics (SDNN, RMSSD, etc.) cannot be computed. Analysis focuses on HR magnitude, reactivity, and interpersonal synchrony.
